LINUX FUNDAMENTALS 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux is a broad term for operating systems that run on UNIX (another operating system). This makes LINUX fit for all purposes and users computing power. For exemple Ubuntu and debian are the most common, you can run servers with ubuntu with as little 512MB of RAM.
This is as similar as windows 7, 8, 10

[WHERE IS LINUX?]
- Websites you visit
- car entertrainement/control pannels
- Point Of Sale (PoP) chekouts, register chops
- traffic lights, industrial sencors
This link is a remote linux machine we will be using to learn (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

[HOW DO WE REMOTELT CONNECT?]
SSH, is our anwser!

[WHAT IS IT?]
ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into remote machines, it is intended to provide
secure encrypted communication between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

[HOW DO WE CONNECT?]
For exemple in bandit level 0 the objective is to login via SSH.
ANSWER:(ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org)

[ssh is invoking the program, -p tells it to connect via port 2220 the user is bandit0 and the host
is bandit.labs.overthewire.org]

EXP : USER:PASSWORD
bandit0:bandit0

You just connected using via ssh congrats!

OUR FIRST COMMAND!
The black screen you see can be quite terrifying but, it is our so called hom, just kidding.
It called a terminal linux is what u call a CLI(Command Line Interface) while windows.
Is whats called a GUI(graphical user interface).

When u have connection it should look like this
[ bandit0@bandit:~$ ]
[ bandit0@bandit:~$ echo "Learning linux is fun" ]
OUTPUT: Learning linux is fun
(This command is called "echo" it can output any text we provide)

[ bandit0@bandit:~$ whoami ]
OUTPUT: bandit0
(This command is called "whoami" find out what user is logged in)

[INTERACTING WITH THE FILE SYSTEM]
ls = listing files, folders, directories
cd = change directory
cat = concatenate
pwd = print working dierectory
