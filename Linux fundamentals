LINUX FUNDAMENTALS  (linux for ethical hackers "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAoFs75_cs")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux is a broad term for operating systems that run on UNIX (another operating system). This makes LINUX fit for all purposes and users computing power. For exemple Ubuntu and debian are the most common, you can run servers with ubuntu with as little 512MB of RAM.
This is as similar as windows 7, 8, 10

[WHERE IS LINUX?]
- Websites you visit
- car entertrainement/control pannels
- Point Of Sale (PoP) chekouts, register chops
- traffic lights, industrial sencors
This link is a remote linux machine we will be using to learn (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

[HOW DO WE REMOTELT CONNECT?]
SSH, is our anwser!

[WHAT IS IT?]
ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into remote machines, it is intended to provide
secure encrypted communication between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

[HOW DO WE CONNECT?]
For exemple in bandit level 0 the objective is to login via SSH.
ANSWER:(ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org)

[ssh is invoking the program, -p tells it to connect via port 2220 the user is bandit0 and the host
is bandit.labs.overthewire.org]

EXP : USER:PASSWORD
bandit0:bandit0

You just connected using via ssh congrats!

OUR FIRST COMMAND!
The black screen you see, can be quite terrifying but it is our so called home, just kidding.
It called a terminal, linux is what u call a CLI(Command Line Interface) while windows.
Is whats called a GUI(graphical user interface).

When u have connection it should look like this
[ bandit0@bandit:~$ ]
[ bandit0@bandit:~$ echo "Learning linux is fun" ]
OUTPUT: Learning linux is fun
(This command is called "echo" it can output any text we provide)

[ bandit0@bandit:~$ whoami ]
OUTPUT: bandit0
(This command is called "whoami" find out what user is logged in)

[FLAGS AND SWITCHES]
--help = help
man = manual pages

[INTERACTING WITH THE FILE SYSTEM]
ls = listing files, folders, directories
cd = change directory
cat(Create single or multiple files, view the content of a file, con(cat)enate files, redirect output in the terminal or files) = concatenate
pwd = print working dierectory
find = find a file or directory
grep = Allows us to search the content of a file for something specific
&& = attach two commands

[CREATE FILES & FOLDERS & DELETE FILES AND FOLDERS]
touch = create a file
mkdir = make directories
cp = copy
mv = move
rm = remove (with -r remove directories)

[SHELL OPERATORS]
& = run commands in the background
&& = attach commands toghther
> = This operator is a redirector, take the output of a command like "cat" to output a file and direct it somewhere
>> = This operator does the same as ">" but appends the output

[PERMISIONS]

[MANAGING PROCCESSES]
The "ps aux" command list the processes currently running and helps the user identifies them by showing there PID(Process identification number).  Once u know the number this command
"-signal pid" is used to terminate it allows you to send it as a signal (if its yours). This is most commonly used are TERM(a request to terminate gracefully) and KILL (a forced kill).
The command interpreter that runs in the background, if followed by "&" you resume immediate control of the shell
- user file changes the owner of the file  "chown"
- the groups file changers owner "chgrp"
- the rights of a file changes its permissions "chmod"

[FILE SYSTEM]
/bin = basic programs
- Short for etcetera or etsy is here to store system files used by the OS
- The sudoers files highlighted below contains the list of users an groups that have the permissions to run sudo or set commands as the root user.
- passwd, shadow files are very special for Linux because it shows how your system stores passwords for each user, encrypted formatting called "sha512"

/boot = linux kernel, needed for early boot process

/dev = Device files

/etc = Configuration file

/home = users personal files

/lib = basic libraries

/media = Mount points for removable (CD/DVD-ROM, USB keys, and so on)

/mnt = Temporary mount point

/opt =  Extra applications provided by third parties

/root = Administrators (root's) personal files
- Administrators (root's) personal files
Unlike the "/home" directory the "/root" folder is actually the home for the "root" system user. This user would have their data in the directory called "/home/root"

/run = Volatile runtime data does not persist across reboots (not yet included in the FHS(files system hierarchy))

/sbin =  System programmes (these are typically only seen by the admin)

/srv = Data used by servers hosted on the system

/tmp = Temporary files (this directory is often emptied at boot)
- Temporary files (this directory is often emptied at boot)
This unique root directory found on LINUX install. Is short for "temporary" the "/tmp" directory is used to store data that is only needed to access once or twice. Like RAM once the computer is restarted, the contents of this folder are cleared out. "/tmp" is a good place too store enumeration scripts

/usr = Applications (this directory is further subdivided into bin, sbin, lib according to the same logic as in the root directory) Furthermore, /usr/share/ contains architecture-independent data. The /usr/local/ directory is meant to be used by the admin for installing apps manually without overwriting files handled by the packaging system (dpkg)

/var = Variable data handled by the servers. This includes log files, queues, spools, and caches.
- This directories stand for variable data, this is one of the main root folders. This folder is frequently accessed or written by services or applications on the directories. For example, log files from running services and applications are written here (/var/log), or other data that is not necessarily associated with a specific user (i.e., databases and the like).

/proc = /proc/ and /sys/ are specific to the Linux kernel (and not part of the FHS). They are used by the kernel for exporting data to user space.

[TERMINAL TEXT EDITORS]

Nano and Vim(btw no one knows how to close vim :q)

NANO
To create a file with nano "nano <files name>"
- searching for text
- copying and pasting
- jumping to a line number
- finding out what line number you are o

VIM
Vim is a much more capable text editor then nano. So knowing it is a good thing for your linux skills.
- Modifiy the keyboard for you custumisation
- syntax highlighting
- VIM works on all terminals
- alot of  cheatsheet

[GENERAL UTTILITIES]
If you want to download anithing from programs, scripts, pictures use, "wget"
This command allows us to download files from the web via HTTP -- as if your accessing a file from your browser. We just need the addresse of the source.

[SCP]
SCP (secure copy) securly lets you copy files. Unlike "cp", this command allows you to transfer files between computers using SSH protocol.
Working on a model of SOURCE and DESTINATION, SCP allowd you to:
- Copy files & directories from your current system to a remote one
- Copy files & directories from a remote system to your system
