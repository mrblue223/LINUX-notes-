LINUX FUNDAMENTALS  (linux for ethical hackers "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAoFs75_cs")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux is a broad term for operating systems that run on UNIX (another operating system). This makes LINUX fit for all purposes and users computing power. For exemple Ubuntu and debian are the most common, you can run servers with ubuntu with as little 512MB of RAM.
This is as similar as windows 7, 8, 10

[WHERE IS LINUX?]
- Websites you visit
- car entertrainement/control pannels
- Point Of Sale (PoP) chekouts, register chops
- traffic lights, industrial sencors
This link is a remote linux machine we will be using to learn (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

[HOW DO WE REMOTELT CONNECT?]
SSH, is our anwser!

[WHAT IS IT?]
ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into remote machines, it is intended to provide
secure encrypted communication between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

[HOW DO WE CONNECT?]
For exemple in bandit level 0 the objective is to login via SSH.
ANSWER:(ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org)

[ssh is invoking the program, -p tells it to connect via port 2220 the user is bandit0 and the host
is bandit.labs.overthewire.org]

EXP : USER:PASSWORD
bandit0:bandit0

You just connected using via ssh congrats!

OUR FIRST COMMAND!
The black screen you see, can be quite terrifying but it is our so called home, just kidding.
It called a terminal, linux is what u call a CLI(Command Line Interface) while windows.
Is whats called a GUI(graphical user interface).

When u have connection it should look like this
[ bandit0@bandit:~$ ]
[ bandit0@bandit:~$ echo "Learning linux is fun" ]
OUTPUT: Learning linux is fun
(This command is called "echo" it can output any text we provide)

[ bandit0@bandit:~$ whoami ]
OUTPUT: bandit0
(This command is called "whoami" find out what user is logged in)

[FLAGS AND SWITCHES]
--help = help
man = manual pages

[INTERACTING WITH THE FILE SYSTEM]
ls = listing files, folders, directories
cd = change directory
cat(Create single or multiple files, view the content of a file, con(cat)enate files, redirect output in the terminal or files) = concatenate
pwd = print working dierectory
find = find a file or directory
grep = Allows us to search the content of a file for something specific
&& = attach two commands

[CREATE FILES & FOLDERS & DELETE FILES AND FOLDERS]
touch = create a file
mkdir = make directories
cp = copy
mv = move
rm = remove (with -r remove directories)

[SHELL OPERATORS]
& = run commands in the background
&& = attach commands toghther
> = This operator is a redirector, take the output of a command like "cat" to output a file and direct it somewhere
>> = This operator does the same as ">" but appends the output

[MANAGING PROCCESSES]
The "ps aux" command list the processes currently running and helps the user identifies them by showing there PID(Process identification number).  Once u know the number this command
"-signal pid" is used to terminate it allows you to send it as a signal (if its yours). This is most commonly used are TERM(a request to terminate gracefully) and KILL (a forced kill).
The command interpreter that runs in the background, if followed by "&" you resume immediate control of the shell
- user file changes the owner of the file  "chown"
- the groups file changers owner "chgrp"
- the rights of a file changes its permissions "chmod"
